first you should have npm install on your device and peerjs third party package to run peer server
then  move to /Server dir and run :

$ npm run dev

it will run three command first "npm start" for react app on port 3000,second "nodemon index" for nodejs backend server on port 5000 
,last "peerjs --port 3002" for peer server on port 3002 ,you free to change the port as you like.

I hope you like my work and plz send me feedback for keep moving
